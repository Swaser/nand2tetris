# The Grand Plan

* Make Jack into a interpreted language using C
* Port the interpreter for microcontroller (ARM or RISC-V)
* Write a code editor integrated acting like a command line, like C64 Basic
* Write a compiler for Jack on Microcontroller

Should I really write an interpreter? It would almost certainly be fast
enough on Raspberry Pi or Teensy. And probably also on RP 2040.

Having an interpreter would probably make things easier and I could refrain
from using Assemby. But Assembly is what I want to learn (together with C).

Or do the VM (not the interpreter). See crafting interpreters for that.
